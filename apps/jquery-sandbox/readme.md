#### jQuery Sandbox

I use this to quickly test jQuery's functionality.

Sometimes merely visiting the app's public page is enough:

* https://prather-mcs.github.io/apps/jQuerySandbox/

&nbsp;  
But sometimes I have to make more modifications to the base code in a local fork, in order to be able to test certain features. (Sometimes you have to add specific HTML to the `index.html` file, sometimes you have to alter a path from `http://` to `https://` or vice versa, or sometimes you may have to alter the jQuery source file &mdash; for three examples of when you might need to fork and modify the project.)
