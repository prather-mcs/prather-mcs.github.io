This was Project 1 of 6 in a Udacity Nanodegree curriculum, which helped build a portfolio of work to help me walk into my first paid job as a web developer.

In this project, I did everything I could to match the design mockup, but it would not have been hard to make changes to personalize this sort of "portfolio" type webpage to be about anyone else, including myself &mdash; it would not have been hard, but it would be a matter of time and effort and care.
