## About this directory / repository

This was a student project which required me to write a fair amount of JavaScript to append HTML onto a shell résumé page. I had to use JavaScript to programmatically build the HTML.

This was the design mock:  
[something]

This is my final product:  
[something]

### This is not a great web page.

Maybe when the course I was in first came out, this could have been an attractive portfolio project. However, now there are better ways of getting variables (like personal résumé data) into templates (like the rest of the web-page which will hold your résumé information).

So I would rather just do a new web-page with ES6 methods, like `fetch()` and template literals, and not invest any more time or energy into making this student project.

Even if someone wanted me to make a template web-page, right now, that can accept data from file or database and render beautifully, I would not use any of the code from this student project. The shell and the architecture of this page given to me by the instructors is just not good by today's standards.

I would make a much better one, if that's what someone wanted me to put my time and energy into.

### The good news.

I learned JavaScript and the jQuery library for this project, and I am even better at them now than when I was a student.
