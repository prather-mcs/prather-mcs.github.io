      <h2>Section 1: My Work As A Student</h2>

      <p>I began studying for a career in Computer Application Development in 2014. Towards this goal, I used the online-education service Udacity almost exclusively.</p>

      <p>At first, I used their free courseware, and I really got some good practice doing that. However, when they introduced <a href="https://www.udacity.com/nanodegree" target="_blank">nanodegrees</a> in October 2014 I elected to pursue the <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001" target="_blank">Front-End Web Development Nanodegree</a>. This was a new type of credential program aimed at giving students the skills to enter Front-End Web Development careers and jobs.</p>

      <p>Section 1a will be showcasing the projects and code I wrote as a nanodegree student, and Section 1b will list and explain the other Udacity courses I have completed.</p>

          <h4>Unit 4: Optimizing Content for Fast User Experience</h4>

          <div class="course-links">

            <h5>Overview of Courses and What I Learned</h5>

            <ul>

              <li>
                <p>Udacity Course: <a href="https://www.udacity.com/wiki/ud884" target="_blank">Web Performance Optimization</a></p>
                <p>This course was taught by <a href="https://www.igvita.com" target="_blank">Ilya Grigorik</a>. He really impressed me. He now works for Google as a Developer Advocate, specifically advocating best practices for fast performance on HTTP networks, having built up a lot of experience with the network technology behind the internet. He even wrote an O'Reilly book on High-Performance Browser Networking. His blog archives are always great for web developers to read when they have time to go deep on technical issues, and his Twitter feed is always tells you what he considers to be the latest good information on such issues.</p>
                <p>This course showed us an excellent <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals" target="_blank">learning portal for web developers</a> built by Google. It has many hours of content to learn from, surveying very many best practices for developers.</p>
                <p>Thanks to this course, I am now also comfortable with the vendor documentation for "Dev Tools" utilities both <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/devtools" target="_blank">in Chrome</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools" target="_blank">in Firefox</a>.</p>
                <p>Finally, this course also introduced us to the <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed" target="_blank">PageSpeed Insights tool</a>, which runs a battery of automated test on any page you are developing to help you make sure you aren't inadvertently and needlessly creating networking bottlenecks for delivering pages to users. This is especially of concern for mobile-friendly development.</p>

            </ul>

            <h5>Final Project, Unit 4</h5>

            <p>Project code:<br><a href="https://github.com/prather-mcs/nano/tree/master/project-4" target="_blank">https://github.com/prather-mcs/nano/tree/master/project-4</a></p>

            <p>The final project for this unit required us to make important changes to a multi-page site to bring its PageSpeed Insights score (PSI was described above under "...What I Learned") from 30 to almost 100, while still perfectly preserving the original appearance and functionality of the site.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>See the original, un-optimized version:<br>
                <a href="https://prather-mcs.github.io/udacity-units/unit-4/initial-state" target="_blank">https://prather-mcs.github.io/udacity-units/unit-4/initial-state</a>
              </li>
              <li>See the same page after it has been fully optimized:<br>
                <a href="https://prather-mcs.github.io/udacity-units/unit-4/final-state" target="_blank">https://prather-mcs.github.io/udacity-units/unit-4/final-state</a>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>To accomplish this, I had make optimizations to (a) delivery of webfonts, (b) delivery of images, (c) delivery and sync/async behavior of JavaScript files, and (d) delivery of CSS style rules.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, with this project, I took the opportunity to get started learning the Node runtime, for the purpose of minifying JS files. So the final state of the code on the live page contains minified JavaScript code, which was a PSI score improvement. For more practice with Node, I also minified the HTML and styling rules, although that was not measured by PSI. There is a lot more to say about Node, but for now I'll summarize it by saying that I consider it a very important toolkit which I value very much.</p>

            <p>Finally, I also re-wrote the JavaScript animation routines on the "pizzeria" page, to change it from <a href="./img/pizza-animation-initial-state.jpg" target="_blank">being extremely janky</a> to <a href="./img/pizza-animation-final-state.jpg" target="_blank">perfectly fluid</a> at 60 fps animation rate. Animation there occurred while you scroll the page and stops when you stop scrolling. The weaker your computer's graphics and CPU resources, the greater the difference you will notice due to my changes. (The linked images can be summarized by saying that I greatly reduced the amount of time spent executing scripts and re-painting the webpage, down from over 50 milliseconds per animation event to single-digit millisecond animations.)</p>

          <h4>Unit 3: Prototypal Inheritance in JavaScript</h4>

          <div class="course-links">

            <h5>Overview of Courses and What I Learned</h5>

            <ul>

              <li>
                <p>Udacity Course: <a href="https://www.udacity.com/wiki/ud015" target="_blank">Object-Oriented JavaScript</a></p>
                <p>This course was taught by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcusphillips" target="_blank">Marcus Philips</a>, CTO and Dean of Instruction at <a href="http://www.hackreactor.com" target="_blank">Hack Reactor</a>. He brought us right up-to-date on the basic best practices for accomplishing Object-Oriented programming styles in JavaScript.</p>
                <p>So we learned how to correctly use <code>Object.prototype</code> and <code>Object.create</code>, the <code>this</code> operator and the <code>new</code> operator, and about the uses and pitfalls of closures.</p>
                <p>I'm proud to say that these concepts, which would doom any developer who does not understand them accurately, are now "no problem" for me.</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>Udacity Course: <a href="https://www.udacity.com/wiki/ud292" target="_blank">HTML5 Canvas</a></p>
                <p>Because the final project of this unit used the HTML <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element as the foundation for rendering game animation, there was a course on the present state of the Canvas API, implemented by browser vendors.</p>
                <p>A mini-project during this course involved using JavaScript to allow page visitors to add arbitrary text to certain images, to thus allow the user to make "meme pics". The course left this Meme Maker App at a stage of development premature for deployment.</p>
                <p>However, (coming soon!) I will develop this Meme Maker App to a point viable for live deployment, and link to it here.</p>
              </li>

            </ul>

          </div>

          <div class="final-project">

            <h5>Final Project, Unit 3</h5>

            <p>Project code:<br><a href="https://github.com/prather-mcs/nano/tree/master/project-3" target="_blank">https://github.com/prather-mcs/nano/tree/master/project-3</a></p>

            <p>I wrote the object-oriented JavaScript to make this re-make of the classic arcade game "Frogger" work:
              <ul>
                <li>Play it now:<br>
                  <a href="https://prather-mcs.github.io/udacity-units/unit-3/index.html" target="_blank">https://prather-mcs.github.io/udacity-units/unit-3/index.html</a>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>

            <p>Of course at this stage of the Nanodegree program, we were not required to write the whole game from scratch, nor to create our own image assets. All images were provided for us, and the code that powers the game was partially done as well.</p>

            <p>The base code would only draw a blank screen, so we had to make decisions like "how big should the road be" and write code to draw the road on the canvas. Then we had to figure out how to draw the moving obstacles (cars, bugs) at an appropriate speed moving from left to right. Then we had to figure out how to have a player sprite which accepted player inputs and would move accordingly. Collision detection was also completely up to us to implement. And in creating our solutions for these design specifications, we had to use both JavaScript's prototypal inheritance and its function closure rules correctly, to come up with an efficent "object-oriented" implementation for the game engine.</p>

            <p>My final game, as linked above, implements only two gameplay features beyond the basic requirements. I allowed pausing the game with a button press, and I implemented collision detection on the cars themselves, such that they would bump into each other, and not be able to pass through slower cars in front of them. I definitely had some great ideas of improvements to make, to make the game actually fun to play, but I noticed several other students do it first:</p>

            <ul>
              <li><a href="http://alexandrk.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game" target="_blank">http://alexandrk.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game</a></li>
              <li><a href="http://arcadegame2000.appspot.com" target="_blank">http://arcadegame2000.appspot.com</a></li>
              <li><a href="http://rachkoud.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/index.html" target="_blank">http://rachkoud.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/index.html</a></li>
              <li><a href="http://anjalinanda.github.io/FroggerGame" target="_blank">http://anjalinanda.github.io/FroggerGame</a></li>
            </ul>

            <p>So I decided to not spend the significant amount of extra time it would take to make a truly fun game, and make it playable on mobile devices, which it really needs to be. My playable version might not be the most impressive thing. However, the feature I implemented where cars have collision detection on themselves and cannot pass through each other is something not one of the other versions did.</p>

            <p>What ought to be impressive is my code behind the game. Not only did I take the time to make it truly efficient through prototypally-inherited common functions wherever possible, but I also put in a lot of time to follow JSDoc commenting rules properly. The JSDoc comment format is as syntactical as a programming language itself, because programs parse JSDoc comments to provide static analysis and automatic documentation. So my code comments here are another programming achievement.</p>

            <p>On the other hand, I now know more about how code is really organized in real-world projects, and there are some shortcomings in this code. I'm talking about the use of global variables, shared by three three separate <code>.js</code> script files. That was basically given to us in that way, with nothing said about changing it or it needing to be changed. I would always want to build code in the modular design pattern (used with <code>require</code> or <code>import</code>), and not rely on global variables external to a script. Or internal to a script, for that matter. I know how to remove global variables altogether. So when I say I'm proud of my code, I just mean that I made it neat and efficient within the framework given to me, even if it's not a realistic framework. Also, using JSDoc should be recognized as a plus.</p>

          <div class="course-links">

            <h5>Overview of Courses and What I Learned</h5>

            <ul>

              <li>
                <p>Udacity Course: <a href="https://www.udacity.com/wiki/ud804" target="_blank">JavaScript Basics</a></p>
                <p>This course introduced the basic JavaScript syntax, data structures, and functions.</p>
                <p>I had decent experience with these in Python, but I was actually totally new at JavaScript before this course.</p>
                <p>After completing future projects and immersing myself daily in web develoment content, I am now fully fluent in JavaScript, very confident with it, and it is my go-to general purpose programming language, thanks to Node. I have a Linter in my text editor to save time by catching syntax typos immediately. And I automate my workflow wherever possible, sometimes with powerful packages like Grunt and Yeoman, and sometimes with custom scripts I wrote myself.</p>
                <p>And all of those that is well beyond the scope of this original course. I sure have come a long way since this class.</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>Udacity Course: <a href="https://www.udacity.com/wiki/ud245" target="_blank">Intro to jQuery</a></p>
                <p>jQuery is a great library to perform DOM-manipulating tasks more safely (in the sense of cross-browser functionality) and quickly than coding up from scratch in Vanilla JavaScript.</p>
                <p>This course was a decent introduction to jQuery, showing you something like 30 different functions from the library, and how to use them.</p>
                <p>At this stage in my development as a proficient web developer, I study the jQuery source code in my spare time, to see how it functions at the Vanilla JS level.</p>
                <p>Finally, one of the first "programs" I ever built I called "jQuery Sandbox". It's not a full program, of course, but what it does is provide an immediate read-eval-print console environment with the jQuery library, so you can test code that requires jQuery immediately, in an environment that contains all of jQuery, but nothing besides.</p>
                <p>You can check out jQuery Sandbox here:<br><a href="./jQuerySandbox/index.html" target="_blank">https://prather-mcs.github.io/jQuerySandbox/index.html</a></p>
                <p>You'll be able to perform commands like<br><code>$('body');</code><br>or<br><code>$('body').append('&lt;img src="http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/streetview?size=600x400&location=Universal+Studios">');</code><br> immediately from your browser's console.</p>
              </li>

            </ul>

          </div>

          <div class="final-project">

            <h5>Final Project, Unit 2:</h5>

            <p>Project code:<br><a href="https://github.com/prather-mcs/nano/tree/master/project-2" target="_blank">https://github.com/prather-mcs/nano/tree/master/project-2</a></p>

            <p>The final project was closely aligned with the JavaScript Basics course, described above. The job was to correctly define data in JavaScript objects, and correctly define and implement functions that would read that data, place it into an HTML element, and then append the HTML to the web résumé document. The style rules were pre-defined such that a "good enough" visual appearance was guaranteed, provided we actually got the JS code right.</p>

            <p>The starting point of the project was here:<br><a href="./udacity-units/unit-2/initial-state/index.html" target="_blank">https://prather-mcs.github.io/udacity-units/unit-2/initial-state/index.html</a><br>(Yes, it only renders "hello world".)</p>

            <p>And it ended up here:<br><a href="./udacity-units/unit-2/final-state/index.html" target="_blank">https://prather-mcs.github.io/udacity-units/unit-2/final-state/index.html</a></p>

            <p>Much like in Project 3, the pre-defined code framework that we were adding onto is not representative of good practice for modern real-world projects. (Global variables, etc.)</p>

            <p>However, the goal was to define JavaScript objects and DOM-manipulating code correctly, and for that goal it was a very good project.</p>
